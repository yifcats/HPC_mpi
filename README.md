HPC Module at Imperial College London: 
Solving Burgers' Equation:

High-Performance Computing project on linux environment where the task was to write a C++ script and to parallelise it, 
utilising open-software MPI for a general number of processes in order to numerically solve Burgers’ equation for various test cases.
After discretising the equation for both space and time, the script enabled me to simulate advection, diffusion and Burgers’ equation. 
The module assessed the accuracy of the solution but also focused on the optimisation of the code to minimise running time. 
This enforced best coding practices as well as the use of ordering of operations, cache locality and flags.
